# v0.1.0

## MAJOR

- improved the rendering canvas so that it will always fit the available screen real estate "from inside", i.e. users won't see any vertical overflow anymore
- store resolution and refresh rate settings to "survive" across sessions
- hide resolution and refresh rate selection buttons by default, reveal only on hover
- added an update checker which checks for available updates for FSdesktop
- hide serial number once submitted to prevent unintentional leaking by content creators or people seeking advice etc.

## MINOR

- make FSdesktop trial period "version-based", i.e. the trial period will reset for every new version
- show version number in title bar
- remove default application menu bar
- changed default server port to less commenly used port 9670
- catch any unexpected errors on the process level and show a user-friendly dialog with a hint to restart FSdesktop and on how to get support
